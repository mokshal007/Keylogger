**Keylogger with Enhanced Features**

This repository contains a Python keylogger script with extended functionalities, designed to provide insights into cybersecurity awareness and help users understand potential threats. Please note that the use of keyloggers for malicious purposes is strongly discouraged and may be illegal. The primary intent of this project is to educate, research, and promote ethical awareness.

**Features:**

1. **Basic Keylogging:** The script captures keystrokes and maintains a log of them.

2. **Webcam Capture:** The keylogger can take snapshots using the webcam.

3. **Screenshot Capture:** It can capture screenshots of a specified region.

4. **Active Window Tracking:** The script logs the titles of active windows.

5. **Website Tracking:** When applicable, it tracks URLs visited in supported browsers.

6. **Webhook Integration:** The captured data, screenshots, and URLs are sent to a Discord webhook for reporting.

7. **Interval Reporting:** The script reports captured data at regular intervals.

**Usage Instructions:**

1. Ensure you have the required packages installed. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. The script requires the `dhooks`, `pynput`, `pyautogui`, and `opencv-python` packages to function correctly.

3. Modify the `WEBHOOK_URL` variable with the URL of your Discord webhook.

4. Adjust the `TIME_INTERVAL` to control the reporting frequency.

5. Run the script and let it monitor keystrokes, capture screenshots, and track URLs (if applicable).

6. This project serves as an educational tool to showcase keylogger behavior and its potential ethical use in cybersecurity awareness and research.

**Ethical Considerations:**

- **Use Responsibly:** This keylogger script should be used responsibly, and any form of misuse is discouraged.

- **Respect Legalities:** It is essential to adhere to ethical and legal guidelines while using or experimenting with such tools.

- **Educational Purposes:** The primary goal is to educate about potential security threats and techniques.

- **Privacy Awareness:** Respect the privacy of individuals and systems at all times.

**Disclaimer:**

The creators of this repository do not endorse or encourage the use of keyloggers for malicious purposes. The script is provided for educational and ethical understanding of cybersecurity practices.

Remember, knowledge is a powerful tool when wielded responsibly and ethically. Always use this tool with good intentions and adhere to applicable laws and regulations.
